/// According to [MS-RDPEFS] 1.1 Glossary:

/// encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).
///
/// This helper function takes a string slice and converts it to a
/// UTF-16LE encoded Vec<u8>, which is useful in cases where we want
/// to handle some data in the code as a &str (or String), and later
/// convert it to RDP's preferred format and send it over the wire.
