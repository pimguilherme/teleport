description: How to backup and restore Teleport cluster state.
---

When planning a backup of Teleport, it's important to know what is where and the
importance of each component. Teleport's Proxies and Nodes are stateless, and thus
only `teleport.yaml` should be backed up.

The Auth server is Teleport's brains, and depending on the backend should be backed up
regularly.

For example, a customer running Teleport on AWS with DynamoDB have these key items of data:

| What | Where ( Example AWS Customer ) |
| - | - |
| Local Users ( not SSO ) | DynamoDB |
| Certificate Authorities | DynamoDB |
| Trusted Clusters | DynamoDB |
| Connectors: SSO | DynamoDB / File System |
| RBAC | DynamoDB / File System |
| teleport.yaml | File System |
| teleport.service | File System |
| license.pem | File System |
| TLS key/certificate | ( File System / Outside Scope ) |
| Audit log | DynamoDB |
| Session recordings | S3 |

For this customer, we would recommend using [AWS best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/BackupRestore.html) for backing up DynamoDB. If DynamoDB is used for
the audit log, logged events have a TTL of 1 year.

| Backend | Recommended backup strategy |
| - | - |
| dir ( local filesystem ) | Backup `/var/lib/teleport/storage` directory and the output of `tctl get all --with-secrets`. |
| DynamoDB | [Follow AWS Guidelines for Backup & Restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/BackupRestore.html) |
| etcd | [Follow etcD Guidleines for Disaster Recovery](https://etcd.io/docs/v2/admin_guide) |
| Firestore | [Follow GCP Guidlines for Automated Backups](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/backups) |

### Teleport resources

Teleport uses YAML resources for roles, trusted clusters, local users, and auth connectors.
These could be created via `tctl` or the UI.

## GitOps

If you're running Teleport at scale, your teams need to have an automated way to restore Teleport. At a high level, this is our recommended approach:

- Persist and backup your backend
- Share that backend among auth servers
- Store your configs as discrete files in VCS
- Have your CI run `tctl create -f *.yaml` from that git directory

## Migrating backends

As of version v4.1, you can now quickly export a collection of resources from
Teleport. This feature was designed to help customers migrate from local storage
to etcd.

Using `tctl get all --with-secrets` will retrieve the below items:

- Users
- Certificate Authorities
- Trusted Clusters
- Connectors:
  - Github
  - SAML \[Teleport Enterprise]
  - OIDC \[Teleport Enterprise]
  - Roles \[Teleport Enterprise]

When migrating backends, you should back up your auth server's `data_dir/storage` directly.

**Example of backing up and restoring a cluster.**

```code
# Export dynamic configuration state from old cluster
$ tctl get all --with-secrets > state.yaml

# Prepare a new uninitialized backend (make sure to port
# any non-default config values from the old config file)
$ mkdir fresh && cat > fresh.yaml << EOF
teleport:
  data_dir: fresh
EOF

# bootstrap fresh server (kill the old one first!)
$ sudo teleport start --config fresh.yaml --bootstrap state.yaml

# from another terminal, verify state transferred correctly
$ tctl --config fresh.yaml get all
# <your state here>
```

The `--bootstrap` flag has no effect, except during backend initialization (performed
by auth server on first start), so it is safe for use in supervised/High Availability contexts.

**Limitations**

- The `--bootstrap` flag doesn't re-trigger trusted cluster handshakes, so trusted cluster resources need to be recreated manually.
- All the same limitations around modifying the config file of an existing cluster also apply to a new cluster being bootstrapped from the state of an old cluster. Of particular note:
  - Changing cluster name will break your CAs (this will be caught and teleport will refuse to start).
  - Some user authentication mechanisms (e.g. WebAuthn and U2F) require that the public endpoint of the web ui remains the same (this can't be caught by teleport, be careful!).
- Any node whose invite token is defined statically (in the config file of the auth server) will be able to join automatically, but nodes that were added dynamically will need to be re-invited
