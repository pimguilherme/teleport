This guide explains how to label Teleport Nodes.

## Labeling nodes and applications

In addition to specifying a custom name for each Node, Teleport also allows for
the application of arbitrary key-value pairs to each Node or app, called labels.
There are two kinds of labels:

- **static labels** do not change over time while the `teleport` process is
  running. Examples of static labels are the physical location of Nodes and the
  name of the environment (e.g., staging vs. production).
- **dynamic labels**, also known as "label commands," allow you to generate
  labels at runtime. Teleport will execute an external command on a Node at a
  configurable frequency and the output of the command becomes the label value.
  Examples include reporting load averages, the presence of a process, and the time after
  the last reboot.

There are two ways to configure Node labels.

- Via command line, by using the `--labels` flag with the `teleport start`
   command.
- Using the `/etc/teleport.yaml` configuration file on a Node.

To define labels as command line arguments, use the `--labels` flag as shown
below. This method works well for static labels or simple commands:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --labels uptime=[1m:"uptime -p"],kernel=[1h:"uname -r"]
```

Alternatively, you can update `labels` via a configuration file:

```yaml
ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # ...
  # Static labels are simple key/value pairs:
  labels:
    environment: test
app_service:
  # ..
  labels:
    environment: test
```

To configure dynamic labels via a configuration file, define a `commands` array
as shown below:

```yaml
ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # Dynamic labels AKA "commands":
  commands:
  - name: hostname
    command: [hostname]
    period: 1m0s
  - name: arch
    command: [uname, -p]
    # This setting tells Teleport to execute the command above
    # once an hour. This value cannot be less than one minute.
    period: 1h0m0s
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # ...
  # Dynamic labels (historically called "commands"):
  commands:
  - name: hostname
    command: [hostname]
    period: 1m0s
```

Notice that the `command` setting is an array where the first element
is a valid executable and each subsequent element is an argument.

This is valid syntax:

```yaml
command: ["/bin/uname", "-m"]
```

This is invalid syntax:

```yaml
command: ["/bin/uname -m"]
```

If you want to pipe several bash commands together, here's how to do it. Notice
how `'` and `"` are interchangeable, so you can use them for nested quotations.

```yaml
command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "uname -a | egrep -o '[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+'"]
```

The executable named in the `command` field must be the path to a valid
executable command. The executable permission bit must be set and shell scripts
must have a [shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_\(Unix\)).
