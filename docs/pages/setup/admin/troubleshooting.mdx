<Notice scope={["cloud"]} type="tip">

These instructions apply to `teleport` processes running on your own
infrastructure in order to access specific resources. In Teleport Cloud, the
Auth and Proxy Services are monitored and managed for you.

</Notice>

## Troubleshooting

To diagnose problems you can configure the `teleport` process to run with
verbose logging enabled by passing it the `-d` flag.

<Notice
  type="warning"
>
  It is not recommended to run Teleport in production with verbose logging as it generates a substantial amount of data.
</Notice>

Sometimes you may want to reset [`teleport`](../reference/cli.mdx#teleport) to a
clean state. This can be accomplished by erasing everything under the `data_dir`
directory, which defaults to `/var/lib/teleport/`.

## Debug dump

You can get a goroutine dump of a running `teleport` process by sending it
`USR1` signal.

Locate a running `teleport` daemon PID:

```code
# Locate teleport process PID
$ pidof teleport
235119
```

Send a `USR1` signal to a `teleport` process:

```code
$ kill -USR1 $(pidof teleport)
```

Teleport will print the debug information to `stderr`. Here what you will see in
the logs:

```txt
INFO [PROC:1]    Got signal "user defined signal 1", logging diagnostic info to stderr. service/signals.go:99
Runtime stats
