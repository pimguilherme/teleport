description: Using Clipboard Sharing with Teleport Desktop Access.
---

Teleport Desktop Access supports copying and pasting text between your browser
and a remote Windows Desktop.

<Admonition type="note">
This feature requires a Chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Brave,
or Microsoft Edge. To use Desktop Access on other browsers, disable clipboard
sharing.
</Admonition>

Clipboard sharing is configured via Teleport's RBAC system. It is enabled by default,
but can be disabled by setting the following role option on one or more of a user's
roles:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: no_clipboard
spec:
  options:
    desktop_clipboard: false
```

If a clipboard sharing is enabled for a user, the browser will prompt for access
to the system clipboard when a desktop session is started. Grant this access to
proceed.

{
    /* screenshot of prompt */
}

If you mistakenly deny clipboard permissions, you can change this setting by
clicking the lock on the left side of your address bar, toggling the clipboard
permission, and refreshing the page.

When a desktop session is active, Teleport will indicate whether clipboard sharing
is enabled in the menu bar at the top of the screen.
