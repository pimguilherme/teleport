# RFD 56 - Teleport Cert Renewal Bot

## What

RFD 56 defines the high-level goals and architecture for a new agent that can
continuously renew Teleport-issued certificates.

## Why

Teleport nodes running the SSH service maintain a connection to the cluster and
are able automatically renew their certificates when a CA rotation takes
place or the certificate is approaching its expiration date.

Unfortunately, external systems that join a Teleport cluster (OpenSSH servers,
databases, applications, etc.) are not under our control, and therefore do not
have a built in mechanism to renew certificates under these circumstances. The
workflow for working with these types of external systems is to generate
certificates via `tctl auth sign`, copy them to the target, and manually
configure the target system to use these certificates. This is a process that
must be repeated whenever a certificate is about to expire. Additionally, this
approach is likely to incur downtime during
[CA rotations](https://goteleport.com/docs/architecture/authentication/#certificate-rotation)
as the renewal has to be performed within the rotation's grace period in order
to maintain connectivity.

This experience can incentivize users to make decisions that conflict with
security best practices, including:

- Requesting certificates with a very large time-to-live (TTL)
- Electing not to perform CA rotations

Both of these decisions are simply delaying the inevitable - eventually, the
certificates will need to be renewed and external systems will need to be
updated. The agent proposed in this RFD intends to automate the process of
renewing these certificates - requiring less manual work on behalf of our users,
and enabling them to use shorter TTLs and perform frequent CA rotations.

## Details

### Goals

The primary user this agent is designed for is the admin who wants to leverage
Teleport for as many systems as possible, but simply does not have the time to
keep track of all certificates and manually renew them.

While users with sophisticated automation and dedicated credential management
tools may benefit from this solution, they likely already have the resources to 
automate certificate renewals.

As a result, a primary goal for this tool is simplicity. We will optimize the user
experience for those looking to add systems to their cluster quickly and easily rather
than supporting a multitude of configuration options and hooks for customization.

### Overview

We will develop a new lightweight tool, `tbot`, which runs as an agent on
external systems that are part of a Teleport cluster (a VM running a Postgres
database, an OpenSSH server, or a CI/CD worker, for example).

This agent will join the Teleport cluster, request certificates, store them in a
user-specified destination, and then monitor the certificates and renew them as
necessary.

#### User Experience

First, register a bot with the new `tctl bots add` subcommand, giving the bot a
name and one or more roles the bot is allowed to
[impersonate](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/impersonation/).

```
$ tctl bots add jenkins --roles=ci
The invite token: 13b74f49d27536dd5c514073097c197b
This token will expire in 60 minutes

...
```

This command will:

- Create a role for the bot, allowing impersonation of the provided roles (`ci`
  in this case)
- Create a new user for the bot, and assign the new bot role to this user
- Generate a special invite token that bot must use to join the cluster. This
  token is scoped to the new user that was created for the bot.

For security purposes, end users should deploy the bot across multiple Unix
users:
1. A dedicated `tbot` user to run the bot itself.
2. One or more service users, e.g. `ci`, where end-user certificates will be
   used to access resources.

As the destination user, the user initializes the certificate directory:
```
ci $ tbot init --bot-user=tbot /home/ci/tbot
```

This creates the destination directory with empty certificate files and grants
the bot user the minimum set of permissions to update the files using POSIX
ACLs (where supported). In this example, the `ci` user maintains full ownership
of all files.

Next, the `tbot` agent will be started under its isolated Unix user with the
generated token (full set of options omitted here for brevity):

```
tbot $ tbot start \
  --name=foo \
  --directory=/home/ci/tbot \
  --auth-server=proxy.example.com:3080 \
  --token=13b74f49d27536dd5c514073097c197b \
  --ca-pin=sha256:...
  ...
```

Both direct dialing or connecting through a Teleport proxy are supported.

The bot joins the cluster and can be seen with the `tctl` command:

```
$ tctl bots ls
ID            NAME       LOCKED    ROLES
0123-4567     foo        false     dev,ssh
```

When the bot starts, it generates a new set of keys (private key and TLS/SSH
public keys), then uses the provided join token to request a signed, renewable
certificate from the auth server. These certificates are stored in a restricted
location, such as `/var/lib/teleport/bot`, and renewed continuously. They are
exclusively used by the bot for renewal and to issue secondary end-user
certificates. Secondary certificates are written to the user-specified location
and are used to access cluster resources.

Note: the join token can only be used once, and is invalidated after first use
or when its TTL expires (whichever comes first). If the bot fails to renew its
certificates before they expire, it will be unable to authenticate with the
cluster and must re-join with a new token.

In the above example, as no additional client configuration has been specified,
the bot will generate only a single set of end-user certificates with access to
the union of all roles specified. Users with additional security requirements
may opt to issue one or more sets of certificates to different locations and
with access to a different set of roles.

For example, given the following command to create a bot:

```
$ tctl bots add --name=example --roles=a,b,c
```

... users may create a configuration file, such as `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
destinations:
  - directory: /home/alice/tbot
    roles: [a, b, c]

  - directory: /home/bob/tbot
    roles: [b, c]
```

The user then starts the bot with the configuration file:

```
$ tbot -c /etc/tbot.yaml start
```

Once the bot fetches its own certificate, it then fetches additional
impersonated certificates for each specified certificate destination and
writes them via the appropriate backend implementation. This may be
particularly useful for CI/CD use cases where untrusted workers run as a
particular user that should not be granted the full set of the bot's
privileges.

### Security

It is important to consider the security implications of a credential that can
be continuously renewed. In order to minimize the blast radius of an attack, we
need to minimize both the scope and duration that an attacker could leverage a
compromised credential as well as encourage end users to deploy the bot in a
way that protects the certificates it generates.

We limit the scope by allowing users to define exactly which roles the
certificate should assume. The `tctl` tool will create a dedicated user and role
for the bot, and this role will be able to impersonate the roles specified by
the user. We encourage users to follow the principle of least privilege and
allow impersonation for the minimum set of roles necessary. Additionally, end
users may further limit the permissions granted to a particular set of
certificates should their workflow support this.

We limit the amount of time an attacker can act with these certificates by
setting an aggressive expiration time on renewable certificates and allowing
users to prevent a bot from renewing certificates with the new `tctl lock`
functionality. A locked bot is unable to renew its certificates, so an attacker
who compromises a bot can only use the certificate until it expires. With a
sufficiently small TTL, the window for a valid attack can be minimized. To
further minimize this window, an administrator can initiate a CA rotation with a
small (or zero) grace period immediately after locking the compromised bot.

While out of scope for the initial implementation, the security of this approach
can be further improved in the future by pinning the certificates to a certain
machine.

#### Locking

Bot locking is functionally identical to user locking as bots are just
specialized users. We will provide a helper command to automatically add the
`bot-` prefix to the underlying user account:

```
$ tctl bots lock example
# ... is functionally equivalent to this:
$ tctl lock --user=bot-example
```

A similar helper will be provided for unlocking, `tctl bots unlock ...`

#### Impersonation

In a naive implementation, the bot might receive a single set of certificates
that would be both renewable and granted the union of all attached roles. If
these certificates were compromised, an attacker would have unfettered access
to cluster resources until either the certificates expire (assuming they don't
bother to renew them) or until a cluster admin notices and locks the bot.

We can mitigate these risks using impersonation. First, impersonation forces us
to split responsibilities for renewal and access. The bot would still be given
(and be responsible for continuously renewing) a user certificate, however this
certificate would be otherwise useless for end users as it would not provide 
access to any resources.

Next, users separately configure one or more certificate outputs. As part of
each renewal event, the bot generates an additional set of *non-*-renewable
certificates and stores them in the designated output. Each of these outputs
may optionally be scoped to a subset of all roles the bot is capable of
assuming.

This design is meant to encourage deployments where the bot's own data
directory, containing the renewable certificate, is separate and inaccessible
to other users on the system, via the native security methods of the output
destination (e.g. Unix permissions, Kubernetes RBAC, etc). The secondary
certificates may be written with relaxed permissions to enable use by end
users. If these secondary certificates are stolen, not only will they not be
renewable, but may also have only a subset of the permissions granted to the
bot.

Unfortunately, Teleport today does not fully support the impersonation UX we
would like to provide with the bot. As is, impersonation requires two `User`
resources: one for the impersonator, and one for the impersonatee. Today, we
could require that users manually create a Teleport user for each set of roles
the bot may assume, however this UX is undesirable. Therefore, we propose
adding the ability to, when requesting user certificates, allow the bot to
"impersonate" its own `User`, but with a set of additional roles as specified
in its certificate. This would enable use of the previously-described
`tctl bots add --roles=...` UX. If desired, this UX remains compatible with
other-user impersonation should we later wish to add an additional
`--users=...` flag.

#### Renewals

There are several scenarios under which the bot will initiate a renewal:

1. When some fraction of a certificate's TTL has elapsed, for example 1/3 (and
   at most 1/2). A certificate valid for 3 hours should be renewed every hour
   to ensure at least one full additional renewal iteration can take place if
   the first fails.

   Tighter renewal intervals also help to ensure compromised certificates are
   discovered sooner (see "Preventing Certificate Propagation" below).
2. When a user and/or host CA rotation is taking place.
3. When a renewal is requested manually. For testing and debugging purposes, the
   bot trigger a renewal when it receives a `SIGUSR1` signal.

While the bot generates multiple sets of certificates - that is, one primary
renewable certificate and many secondary end-user certificates - they are all
renewed at roughly the same time, and secondary certificates have an expiration
matching the primary certificate. It may be possible in the future to have
secondary certificates with a shorter TTL than the primary (probably 1/n
durations) but this is out of scope for the initial implementation.

To help ensure renewals complete successfully, when a `SIGTERM` signal is
received, the bot will delay exiting until any ongoing rotation completes.
Where possible, we should aim to avoid any of the following situations:
 * Writing invalid certificates to disk (especially those that might prevent
   future renewals from succeeding if the bot is restarted)
 * Generating valid certificates but failing to save them (which might result
   in a certificate generation counter mismatch; see below for more info)

#### Preventing Certificate Propagation

Renewable certificates present an obvious security concern as they can be
renewed indefinitely, at least until a cluster admin decides to remove or lock
the bot user. Additionally, as renewing a certificate does not invalidate
previously-issued certificates, one compromised certificate can lead to an
unlimited number of indefinitely-renewable descendent certificates. To make
things worse, in Teleport today, this certificate propagation is somewhat
difficult to detect.

As a mitigation strategy, we propose adding a new certificate generation
counter (as a certificate extension) that increments each time a certificate
is renewed. This latest generation count is additionally stored on the auth
server as a system annotation on the bot user.

On subsequent renewals, while generating user certificates on the auth server,
the current certificate is inspected and its current generation is compared to
the stored version on the auth server. If this generation counter is less than
the auth server's stored counter, this implies that multiple bots are competing
for renewals of the same certificate lineage.

Running bot instances will establish a filesystem lock on the bot data
directory to ensure only a single local instance can be started at any time.
Additional renewal attempts using the same credentials with a mismatched
certificate generation counter are presumed to be malicious and will
immediately lock the bot user, preventing further renewal.

Additionally, to further restrict renewals, impersonated certificates will be
generated with a "disallow-reissue" flag to entirely prevent malicious
renewals of a compromised secondary / end-user certificate.

Lastly, regardless of the initial certificate's TTL, we can have the auth
server ensure that, when renewing, renewed certificate TTLs may only decrease
in length. This would prevent an attacker from stealing a renewable certificate
and immediately requesting a new certificate with the auth server's max
renewable TTL.

#### Artifacts

For internal use, the bot generates a set of renewable TLS certificates.
This set of credentials is only used certificate renewal, user certificate
generation, and establishing CA rotation watches. These artifacts should be
persisted to some private location to allow the bot to recover after a process
restart.

| Kind                   | Path         | Notes                            |
|------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| TLS CA certificates    | `tlscacerts` | Teleport cluster CA certs (both) |
| TLS client certificate | `tlscert`    | Signed by Teleport `UserCA`      |
| Private key (TLS)      | `key`        |                                  |

The bot then generates a set of non-renewable credentials for each configured
credential destination. In the initial implementation, the following artifacts
may or may not be generated depending on the user's configuration (kind and
templates).

| Kind                   | Path          | Notes                                   | Kind | Config Template
| -----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|------|---------
| Private key            | `key`         | Shared for both SSH and TLS uses        | Both | Always
| SSH public key         | `key.pub`     | Required for OpenSSH compatibility      | SSH  | Always
| SSH client certificate | `sshcert`     | Signed by Teleport `UserCA`             | SSH  | Always
| SSH known hosts        | `known_hosts` | Teleport `HostCA` certs, OpenSSH format | SSH  | `ssh-client`
| SSH client config      | `ssh_config`  | `Include`-ready SSH client config       | SSH  | `ssh-client`
| TLS CA certificates    | `tlscacerts`  | Teleport CA certificates (both)         | TLS  | Always
| TLS client certificate | `tlscert`     | Signed by Teleport `UserCA`             | TLS  | Always

In the case of `directory` destinations, we encourage the use of POSIX ACLs.
This is meant to ensure that the primary (renewable) credentials are
exclusively readable to the bot while the secondary (non-renewable)
credentials are readable only to the target user but still writable by the
bot. The `tbot init` subcommand can be used to configure ACLs automatically
where supported. At runtime, the bot will verify destination permissions and
warn if ACLs are not configured correctly when writing or updating
certificates.

As an additional security measure for `directory` destinations, a warning will
be emitted if the destination path does not resolve to the configured path,
i.e. if symlinks are used. This may be innocuous, but may indicate an attempt
to steal credentials.

Notes:
 * Users may optionally decide to disable persistence of the renewable
   certificate using the `memory` storage backend. This has security benefits
   but prevents the bot from recovering if stopped as the renewable credentials
   would only exist in memory.
    * Other joining methods (e.g. IAM / EC2 joining) may mitigate this
      downside.
 * The Teleport auth server's CA certificates are verified at first connect
   using CA pins, following Teleport's usual node joining procedure.
 * Unneeded certificate types/formats could be optionally disabled in
   `tbot.yaml` config if desired.
 * Additional artifacts may be written if users enable any app-specific config
   templates.
 * In the future, we could consider ephemeral certificate destinations for
   situations where certificates should not be written to disk (Webhooks or
   other IPC?)

#### Reload Events

To enforce security best practices, the bot itself provides no builtin methods
for signalling or otherwise executing user code when a certificate rotation
occurs. Instead, end users are encouraged to use filesystem watches (e.g.
`inotify`) to watch for changes directly using a least-privileged system user.
We will include a helper command, `tbot watch`, to perform simple actions on
various update events, such as executing a user script.

A number of alternative notification types were considered and found to have
limitations:

 * User scripts: either forces the bot to run as `root` to execute scripts
   as another user, or executes as the bot's user. The latter case simply
   offloads the problem (how will the user script then securely interact with
   the app to reload?)
 * Unix signals: requires either the same user, root, `CAP_KILL`, or SUID, plus
   requires a way to query for the correct process. Impractical for the same
   reasons as shell scripts aren't.
 * D-Bus: complex, unclear permission semantics, relatively poor OS
   compatibility.
 * Webhooks: complex and poses challenges implementing securely.
 * Unix sockets: challenging permissions semantics (still relies on ACLs and
   `libc` has related edge cases).

#### IAM / EC2 Joining

The bot will support joining via AWS IAM identity verification similar to the
process described in our [Joining Nodes in AWS][aws-join] guide:

 1. End user creates a provisioning token via a YAML file. This file is
    identical to static node join tokens but adds a new `bot_name` field.
 2. When creating a bot, the end user specifies a `--token=[name]` flag to
    indicate a static token should be used.
 3. `tctl bots add --token=...` prints a customized onboarding command

Bots joined to the cluster in this way do not receive renewable certificates.
The IAM / EC2 joining use-case implies potentially many bot instances
associated with the same bot user, and we expect these will often be
short-lived. This leads to a few problems with renewable certificates:

 1. Renewable certificates that are not continually renewed (because the
    job that issued them has completed, for instance) can be stolen without
    triggering a certificate generation mismatch.
 2. It breaks the simple implementation of generation counters, of which each
    user only has a single generation counter. This is solvable but not
    worthwhile given the above: it would just allow each certificate lineage
    to be separately stolen.

Instead, we opt to have bots renew certificates by continually
re-authenticating using the IAM join method. As EC2 joining relies on instance
identity documents which can themselves be stolen, this join method will
initially not be supported until a workaround is developed.

[aws-join]: https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/guides/joining-nodes-aws/

### Implementation

The bot will be implemented as a standalone tool (ie under `tool/tbot`) and
_not_ as a service that runs in a `teleport` process.

The bulk of the new logic (parsing configuration, writing certificates to a
destination, etc.) will be implemented in a new `renew` package, which will
enable us to start with a standalone bot, and incorporate this functionality
into other parts of Teleport (ie database access) in the future.

#### API Objects

On the backend, registering a new bot (via `tctl`) creates a set of related API
objects:

- a non-interactive User for the bot to act as (when user certs are requested)
- a role for the bot, which will contain the minimum set of permissions
  necessary to watch for CA rotations, as well as the ability to impersonate
  other roles
- a token that the bot can use to join the cluster for the first time

In order to discover related objects and ensure that no "zombie" items are left behind,
`tctl` will ensure that:

- the objects related to a bot all follow a standardized naming convention that
  includes the name of the bot
- a new `teleport.dev/owned-by` label is applied to all resources related to a
  particular bot

Note: end users should never need to manually create, modify, or delete these
objects. All operations on bots and their related objects is performed through
the `tctl bots` subcommand.

#### `tbot` configuration

The goal is to keep tbot configuration to a minimum to make for a quick getting
started experience, however we recognize many use cases may quickly become
difficult to encode on the command line.

To that end, we'd like to follow the philosophy of "keep simple things simple
but make complex things possible": the simplest / most popular use cases should
ideally require minimal (zero?) configuration beyond a concise CLI, but more
complicated use cases can make use of a `tbot.yaml` configuration file.

An example `tbot.yaml` with all default / advanced options specified:

```yaml
# Storage for the bot's private data
storage:
  # can also support any backend supporting both store + fetch
  directory: /var/lib/teleport/bot

  # alternatively, we can store these certificates only in memory:
  # memory: {}

# Destinations specify one or more impersonated certificates sets to generate.
destinations:
  # `directory` is the only destination supported in the initial iteration;
  # the tbot process must be given permissions to write to this directory.
  - directory: /home/alice/tbot

    # One of more roles to grant to the bot. It must have been granted (at
    # least) these roles with `tctl bots add --roles=...`
    # By default, all possible roles are included.
    roles: [a, b, c]

    # Which types of certificates to generate. `ssh` is the default.
    kinds: [ssh]

    # A list of configuration templates to generate and write to the
    # destination. Defaults are decided based on the certificate kinds:
    # `ssh` implies `ssh-client` unless manually (not) configured.
    configs:
      # ssh-client generates known_hosts and an ssh_config that can be
      # included. We can ensure the correct certificate kinds are generated
      # while generating the config templates.
      - ssh-client

  - directory: /home/bob/tbot
    roles: [b, c]

    # TLS certificates can be generated for app / db access.
    kinds: [ssh, tls]

    configs:
      # Some future configuration templates may require parameters.
      # (This is an example; ssh-server may not need this or any parameters)
      - ssh-server:
          hostname: example.com
  
  # Some backends may optionally accept advanced parameters via an object:
  - directory:
      path: /foo/bar
      symlinks: insecure
```

In future iterations, additional output destination backends may be considered.
A few ideas include:
 * Kubernetes secrets (to run a bot safely in k8s without requiring a PV)
 * Webhook delivery (or other local IPC methods) to keep certificates in memory
 * Ansible vault / Hashicorp vault / AWS secrets manager / other secret stores

*TODO*: how can a user specify DNS names to include in the certs?

#### External Configuration Assist

One of the more time consuming aspects of setting up mutual TLS is configuring
both sides to present the correct certificate and trust certificates signed by a
specific CA. We aim to simplify this configuration process in two ways:

1. Generating additional configuration files from a template as part of the
   renewal loop.

   Many applications require that certificates be formatted in non-standard
   ways, depend on additional parameters that require a Teleport API client
   to fetch, may change over time, or may require multiple files. OpenSSH
   client configuration alone meets most of these criteria.

   Users can specify which additional configuration files to generate in
   `tbot.yaml` (initially only `ssh-client` will be provided). Templates that
   require no additional configuration can be specified on the command-line.
2. Providing a `tbot config` helper command for "last-mile" configuration and
   instructions.

   For applications that can consume the bot's generated credentials directly,
   this outputs a minimal configuration example with brief instructions.

   For applications supported by a config template as described above, this
   generates a snippet to make use of the generated file, e.g.
   `Include <path to tbot ssh_config>` for SSH config.

For example, to configure an SSH client, first users will configure `tbot` to
generate an `ssh_config` file:

```yaml
destinations:
  - directory: /home/alice/tbot
    configs: [ssh-client]
```

When the user next starts the bot using this config, it will write an
`ssh_config` and a `known_hosts`, per the template:
```
$ tbot start -c tbot.yaml
```

Next, the user configures their SSH client to use the generated config:
```
$ tbot config ssh -c tbot.yaml
To configure your SSH client, add the following to your local SSH configuration
(~/.ssh/config):

Include /home/alice/tbot/ssh_config
```

Where possible, the informative text is written to stderr to allow easy
appending:

```
$ tbot config ssh -c tbot.yaml >> ~/.ssh/config
The following SSH config snippet was written to the pipe:

Include /home/alice/tbot/ssh_config
```

Notes:
 * This is a contrived example as the `ssh-client` template is always generated
   by default for `ssh`-typed certificates, which are themselves the default
   In other words, `ssh_config` and `known_hosts` are generated if no
   `tbot.yaml` is specified.
 * `tctl auth sign` has a tiny amount of configuration templating already for
   Postgres and MongoDB certificates. We should aim to move this logic out into
   a separate package that can render configuration snippets for a variety of
   external systems. This work is out of scope for the purposes of this RFD.

#### Renewal cycle

New certificates are requested immediately upon bot startup, regardless of
time until expiration. The bot then enters a renewal loop at a user-requested
interval using the `teleport/lib/utils/interval` package.

#### Initial User Certificates

In order for the bot to obtain its first set of user certificates, a new
gRPC endpoint will be added to the API server which will mimic the host
registration flow, accepting a pre-generated token and a public key to sign,
but will use user tokens instead of provisioning tokens.

Today, user tokens can be used to initiate the user invite flow, handle password
resets, and manage the account recovery process. In order to generate initial
user certificates, we will introduce a new type of user token for certificate
renewal bots.

When the backend receives the request to generate new user credentials, it validates
the token, ensuring that the token is of the correct type and has not expired.

This flow can be extended to support other auth methods beyond simple token
registration; for example, we will additionally support joining using the AWS IAM
join method used for nodes today. See also:
[Simplified Node Joining for AWS](./0041-aws-node-join.md)

#### Renewable User Certificates

Teleport's current behavior when re-issuing a user certificate is maintain the
original expiration time and refuse to bump out the TTL. We plan to preserve
this behavior by default, and only allow for extending the expiration date on
certificates that have been marked renewable.

In order to mark a certificate as renewable, we'll include a new extension in
the certificate's subject field. This attribute will only be set by teleport
when the certificates are first issued using the new endpoint and user token.

## Appendix: Audit Log Events

The auth server will emit new events to the audit log when:

- a new bot user is created
- a new renewable certificate is issued for the first time
- a certificate is renewed
- a bot is locked
- a bot is removed (likely due to failed heartbeating or expired certificates)
- a certificate generation counter conflict is detected (certificate possibly compromised)

## Appendix: Internal Teleport Changes Summary

* Changes to existing functionality:
  * Role requests: impersonation is extended to no longer require a target user;
    users may be granted permission to impersonate individual roles:
    ```yaml
    allow:
      impersonate: 
        roles: ['foo', 'bar']
    ```

    Users may then request a subset of allowed roles using a new certificate
    request field, `RoleRequests`. The returned certificate will show the user
    as impersonating themselves, with a _replaced_ (not appended) list of
    roles.
  * Renewable certs: certain certificates may be renewed beyond their original
    TTL.
  * `auth.Register` extended to support bot joining (i.e. returning bot user
    certificates)
* New auth gRPC endpoints:
  * `CreateBot()`: creates a new bot (user + role) and returns a join token
  * `DeleteBot()`: deletes a bot (user + role)
  * `GetBotUsers()`: fetches all bot users
* New TLS certificate extensions:
  * `disallow-reissue`: entirely prevents an identity from interacting with
    `generateUserCerts`, used to prevent privilege re-escalation with role
    impersonated certificates
  * `renewable`: if set, allows certificates to be renewed beyond their
    original expiration date
  * `generation`: a certificate generation counter incremented for each
    renewal of a certificate, used to detect stolen certificates
  * `role-requests`: a list of roles to request using role impersonation which
    will replace the requestor's existing Teleport roles, used to generate
    reduced-privilege certificates
